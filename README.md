## What is Transmit?

Transmit, developed by Panic, is a renowned and powerful application that redefines file transfers and remote server management on the Apple Mac platform. It is much more than a simple FTP client; it is an essential tool for anyone who regularly works with files stored on web servers, cloud storage platforms, or other remote locations.

This application provides a beautifully designed, user-friendly interface that presents your local files and remote server contents side-by-side. This allows for effortless dragging and dropping of files, making complex transfers incredibly simple. Transmit supports an extensive list of services and protocols, including FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, and integrates natively with popular cloud destinations such as Amazon S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft Azure.

Engineered for speed and reliability, Transmit ensures your file operations are completed quickly and without interruption. Its advanced features include folder synchronization, which can mirror directories with a single click, and a powerful "Transmit Disk" feature that lets you mount remote servers as local disks in Finder. Whether you are a web developer deploying a site, a photographer backing up to the cloud, or a business user managing digital assets, Panic Transmit offers the robust functionality and polished experience expected from a top-tier Mac utility. It is fully optimized for modern macOS versions and runs flawlessly on both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.
